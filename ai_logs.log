2024-12-30 - CRITICAL FIX: Card Type Limiting System
ISSUE: Card type limiting was not working properly - allowed more than 2 cards of same type
PROBLEM: Cards were loaded in batches of 20, filtering only happened on batch load, not real-time

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Real-time type validation in handleCardSwipe() function
✅ Added type count check: currentTypeCount < 2 before allowing selection
✅ Implemented moveToNextValidCard() to automatically skip invalid cards
✅ Added useEffect to advance past invalid cards when selectedTypeCount changes
✅ Updated loadNewCards() to find first valid card index
✅ Reordered functions to avoid calling issues

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- handleCardSwipe() now checks selectedTypeCount[card.type] before allowing selection
- moveToNextValidCard() loops through remaining cards to find next valid one
- useEffect monitors selectedTypeCount changes and auto-advances past invalid cards
- loadNewCards() ensures we start with a valid card after loading new batch
- System enforces STRICT limit of maximum 2 cards per type

RESULT: Card type limiting now works perfectly - no more than 2 cards of any type can be selected!
STATUS: CARD TYPE LIMITING SYSTEM FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅
